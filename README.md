This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

The report index is available at [http://localhost:3000/reports](http://localhost:3000/reports).

## Weekly sales PDF runtime

The weekly sales report uses Puppeteer to print the same Next.js report route as
a one-page PDF. Local development automatically uses the current localhost
origin. In a non-local or production environment, set `REPORT_RENDER_ORIGIN` to
the application origin that the server-side browser can reach, for example:

```bash
REPORT_RENDER_ORIGIN=https://reports.example.com npm run start
```

The configured value must be an HTTP or HTTPS origin. The PDF endpoint always
uses the fixed `/reports/weekly-sales` path with validated `start` and `end`
dates plus application-owned `print=1`; it does not accept a caller-supplied
render URL.

Run the focused report tests with `npm test`, lint with `npm run lint`, and
create a production build with `npm run build`.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
